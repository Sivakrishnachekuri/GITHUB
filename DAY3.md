Here is the difference between git add . vs git add *, git revert vs git reset, and an explanation of .gitignore in table format:



# Git Command Comparison and Explanation

## 1. Difference Between `git add .` vs `git add *`

| **Command**       | **Description**                                                   | **Key Differences**                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git add .`       | Stages all changes in the current directory and all subdirectories. This includes new files, modifications, and deletions. | - Stages changes in the current directory and subdirectories. <br> - Stages new files, modified files, and deletions. |
| `git add *`       | Stages all files in the current directory but **does not include subdirectories**. It will not include dotfiles (files starting with a dot, e.g., `.gitignore`). | - Stages files in the current directory only. <br> - Does not include files in subdirectories. <br> - Does not stage dotfiles. |

## 2. Difference Between `git revert` vs `git reset`

| **Command**       | **Description**                                                   | **Key Differences**                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `git revert`      | Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit. The commit history remains intact. | - Reverts changes by creating a new commit. <br> - Keeps commit history intact. <br> - Safe for use in shared/public repositories. |
| `git reset`       | Resets the current branch to a specific commit and can modify the staging area or working directory, depending on the options used. | - Can modify commit history, staging area, and working directory. <br> - **`--soft`**: Keeps changes in the staging area. <br> - **`--mixed`**: Keeps changes in the working directory. <br> - **`--hard`**: Resets everything (working directory and commit history). <br> - Can be dangerous if used in shared/public repositories. |

## 3. Explanation of `.gitignore`

| **Item**                | **Description**                                                       | **Use Case**                                                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.gitignore` File        | A special file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a repository. | - Exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked. |
| **Common Uses**          | 1. Build files: Temporary files that are generated during the build process.<br> 2. Dependency directories: E.g., `node_modules/` or `vendor/`.<br> 3. Configuration files: Sensitive or local files like `.env`, `.vscode/`.<br> 4. IDE files: Configuration files for editors like `.idea/` or `.vscode/`. | - Keeps repository clean and avoids tracking files that don't need to be versioned. |
| **Example `.gitignore`** | ```gitignore<br>node_modules/ <br>*.log <br>.env <br>.DS_Store <br>.vscode/ <br>``` | - Excludes unnecessary files from version control. |

### Conclusion

- **`git add .` vs `git add *`**:
  - `git add .` stages all changes in the current directory and subdirectories, including new files, modified files, and deletions.
  - `git add *` stages only the files in the current directory and ignores subdirectories and dotfiles.
  
- **`git revert` vs `git reset`**:
  - `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit, preserving commit history.
  - `git reset` alters commit history and can modify the working directory or staging area, making it more destructive and suited for local changes.

- **`.gitignore`**:
  - It is used to specify files and directories Git should ignore, keeping the repository clean and preventing unnecessary files (like build files, dependencies, or sensitive configurations) from being versioned.
